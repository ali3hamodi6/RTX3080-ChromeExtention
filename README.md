#RTX3080 or 3090 ChromeExtention
-Unzip the folder
-open chrome and type this url  chrome://extensions/
-there is a radio button on top right of page called "developer mode" turn it on
-drag and drop the RTX folder that you unzipped
-the extension button will appear with extensions.
-choose which website to monitor (bestbuy, newegg, amazon)
-the bot will open a new tab and keep refreshing the page until stock become available and it will click the add to cart button and make a sound to let you finish the order. You will have to finish the checkout yourself. I used it to get ps5 and rtx3090 by keeping my computer open with sound being very loud so I can complete the order once add to cart button has been located and clicked.
